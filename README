This is a Prototype/technology test for a small Multiplayer Game based on WebGL/node.js

Known bugs:
* Keyboard bug : On some keyboards, you can't push UP+LEFT+SPACE (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)#Key_jamming_and_ghosting)
* The player 'ship' is not on the same plane as others (roughtly 45Â°)
* the positions of enemy players seems not to be well synched
* when you change tab the game stays in the same state (may have to use timers for everything !)

TODO:
* make a 'weapon' class to handle all weapons related stuff (allowing to clean up controls)
* collisions
* weapon hits & player life
* try to lower/optimize the datas sent
  - don't send moving data if a player don't move
  - try to merge some queries
  - check if there is a way to lower the http datas
* benchmark for memory usage client side
* cleanup the names in Game.js and Api.js so it is more clear what method is called when receiving data and when sending data (bomb addBomb are not explicit enough)

less important
* do some server side checks for cheating
* third person camera
* make a UI class with hooks
* a real game field
* better player model
